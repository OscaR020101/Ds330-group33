# Stock Sentiment Analysis

#### Jiaqi Liu & Jingxuan Wang

Our project is about stock trend prediction using sentiment analysis. In this code file, we implemented four supervised machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Long Short-Term Memory, and Gated Recurrent Unit. Our performance evaluation is based on a confusion matrix.

## Directions to Run

1. Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages.
2. Change `sample_config.yaml` to `config.yaml` and fill in your api keys and other configurations.
3. Run `python main.py`.
4. The final version code is in `main_final_version_ds340w.ipynb`.
5. Try different data files, change the file name in the code to load the different files.

#### Hope you can enjoy playing with our code.
